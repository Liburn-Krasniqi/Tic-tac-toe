# Tic-tac-toe game in python

Tic-tac-toe game that implements the minimax algorithm to play optimally as your opponent.
The AI bot is impossible to beat.

Will be adding multiple difficulties later on, speed optimizations and multiplayer mode for friends who dont want to play against the AI bot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To be able to run this game on your machine you must install [pygame lib](https://www.pygame.org/) and activate a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
